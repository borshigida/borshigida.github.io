I am a PhD student at [Princeton ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) working on theoretical and empirical deep learning and mathematical statistics. I am privileged to be advised by [Matias D. Cattaneo](https://cattaneo.princeton.edu/) and [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/). Prior to Princeton,
I studied mathematics (specializing in probability theory) at Moscow State University in Moscow where I grew up, and worked part-time as a software engineer at Yandex (Russian search company).
I have enjoyed both writing code / keeping track of experiments and proving theorems.
